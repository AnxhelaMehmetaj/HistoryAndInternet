      <h3>People and Internet</h3>
      <p>
        Not everyone is talented or lucky enough to become a movie star or musician or have mass mainstream media followings. These people that were movie stars, musicians, famous celebrities had thousands of dollars of equipment following them and capturing their daily life. Some of these people also controlled what the average person would watch on Television. “Everyone has the opportunity and should have the opportunity to be heard” expresses YouTube CEO, Chad Hurley. In this ecosystem of YouTube everyone had the opportunity to share videos of themselves to millions of people who used the Internet. This was just one of the beginnings of the new form of online media sharing. Then came Napster. An online peer to peer network that allowed users to share music. Fanny, the founder of Napster thought of this idea out of the necessity of trying to find music on the internet and getting frustrated constantly. Napster soon had millions of downloads making it one of the fastest growing applications on the Internet. With the sudden rise to fame, Napster found itself in legal issues. Records labels and lawyers saw how Napster was distributing copyrighted material for free within their network and were loosing revenue from sales due to it. Bands and artists such as Metallica and Dre, despised Napster for distributing their music online for free. Soon this escalated to the court room and Napster was told that it had to shut down. Tech giant, Steve Jobs from Apple, took this idea of music sharing and made it legal by having to pay for music to be downloaded to devices and be copyrighted at the same time. Record labels loved this. However, YouTube found itself in the same situation as Napster and record labels and copyrighted material owner were starting to take notice once again. The term Web 2.0 came about during this time of YouTube and Napster and was defined as user generated content. User generated content brought the rise of Myspace. A website where anyone can create a profile for anyone to see. Millions of people had a Myspace account and soon took over google in search results. Another website also rose to popularity during this time called Facebook. Like most startups, this company was also started by a college student in their dorm then having to move to Silicon Valley and then becoming filthy rich. Now there were two tech giants in this Web 2.0 era. Facebook becoming the long term victor. Not everyone was about making millions on the web. In fact, the founder of Craigslist and Wikipedia '
        offer their service for free online. Ultimately the Web, became a place for sharing and the new form of communication that everyone used.

      <h3> Dot Com</h3>


      <p>
        Successful people try to commercialize anything they think they can profit from. Pierre, the founder of eBay, did exactly that with his online auction market. On eBay anyone was able to new or used items and anyone would be able to buy it or place a bid on an auction. On the other hand, there was Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon, who sold books online to people everywhere. These two companies were instantly making millions of dollars in revenue every year and the analysts at Wall Street kept an eye out for these companies. Like most tech startups, Jeff Bezos at Amazon focused on getting big fast. Amazon would sacrifice profit just to be able to make revenue and grow even faster. He pretty much didn’t care if he was losing money in the short term as he new it would be big in the future. Analysts also took notice of how big Amazon was becoming in such a short amount of time that they started to doubt Amazon and its power to produce profit. Other analysts looked the other way and thought Amazon is truly the next big thing. Once Amazon and eBay started trading publicly, their owners became billionaires instantly. Their rise to fame and richness inspired many other people to not only invest in their company but also move to Silicon Valley where all the tech startups were happening, and people were getting rich. As millions of people were finding out about how profitable these tech companies can be, they started pouring money into the stock market to any company that had a dot com attached to it. Even more people started investing into these companies stocks as tech companies spent millions in advertisement such as in the Superbowl in 2000. Even more tech startups were emerging because of this and venture capitalists wanting to invest in the next big thing threw money at companies that sometimes didn’t even makes sense investing in. If it was a tech startup, it would be handed money and be traded publicly. It wasn’t too long before people started to speculate the validity of these tech startups and doubt their growth. Inevitably, the stock market crashed, and investors lost millions of dollars. The NYSE and Nasdaq fell and investors were furious at wall street analysts for recommending them to buy into tech startups. The damage was already done and almost 3 trillion dollars disappeared from the stock market. However, some people argue that the dot com bubble was a good thing. Since many tech companies that started up were pretty trash to begin with this left all the strong companies alive and moved the economy forward. In fact, there were now more experienced people who were
        able to create tech startups as not become a failure. Then came Myspace, Facebook and YouTube.
