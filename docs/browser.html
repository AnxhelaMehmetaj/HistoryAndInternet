      <p>
        In the early days of the World Wide Web, using the Internet was limited to those who knew how to use it. Being able to surf the World Wide Web with ease was the goal of Mark Andreessen, a University of Illinois Computer Science student. “He imagined a future were everyone including regular people, could use the web as part of our regular lives”. Mark, was the inventor of the first graphical web browser, Mosaic. Within months he had millions of regular people that downloaded his browser and who were using it. When Jim Clark, a very wealthy business man from silicon valley, found out about how many users this browser had, he sent Mark a business opportunity. Mark, being a Junior in college, was astounded from the offer for a full time position and became business partners with Jim Clark under Netscape Communications. The only thing between Jim and Mark and mass fortune were business rivals Microsoft. At the time Microsoft had virtually a monopoly on computer operating systems. Bill Gates, the owner of Microsoft and Harvard dropout, were stopping and destroying small tech startups that were trying to overthrow them from their monopoly. When Netscape released their new web browser, Navigator, it got over 1 millions downloads and got the attention of many important people, specifically Bill Gates. The massive amount of downloads that Navigator was getting made him realize that web browsers are the next big thing and Gates would try to destroy anyone from becoming more powerful than him, starting the browser wars. Bill Gates wanting to take the easy victory and offered Netscape Communications 1 millions dollars for their company. However, since Netscape had a well known Anti-trust Lawyer with them, legal actions was to be taken against Microsoft. At some point, Netscape Communication went public and had and IPO. Its IPO went crazy and made the owners of Netscape richer than they already were. At this point the people at Netscape felt invincible and started downplaying Microsoft, the giants in technology at the time. Microsoft just about had enough from Netscape and released their own internet browser called Internet Explorer. Within a few months, Netscape shares plummeted and soon ceased to exist. However, it wasn’t the end of the war for Microsoft as they now faced the federal US government. Being found guilty of breaking anti trust laws, Gates had to split Microsoft up, but before an appeal was made. Many people saw this as Microsoft g
        etting away with murder but the damage had already been done and Netscape was no more. The ultimate victor of the browser wars- Microsoft.

      <h3> Netscape Vs Microsoft</h3>


      <p>
        Let’s talk about about the “Browser Wars.” Jim Clark and its renegade band of young web browser pioneers would launch the fastest-growing software company the world had ever seen.Netscape Communications under the watchful eye of Clark were adherent to the cause of spreading the reach of the still embryonic web and hopefully getting rich in the process. Back in Illinois the gang had created the first graphical web browser mosaic. Now they would work like maniacs to build a new browser based on that and turn the internet into the future of Commerce and communication. I think the mission of the group was to take over the world as quickly as possible. Knowing nothing big or really grand they would just go out there and make software so compelling and so great that you'd have to be an idiot not to want it. That was the way Jim expressed things. There lie small goals and to go out there and take over the world and do something that was great. But everyone at Netscape knew that time was of the essence. The web was becoming more popular with every passing day. The fear was that another more powerful company would see its potential and launch a browser before Netscape had a chance to. There was an extreme sense of urgency that once they started it wasn't a hard thing to do. Thomas Riordan at one point contacted the young company to sniff around for information and found that Netscape came off a different public vibe one of supreme arrogance. We were kind of aware of them at a distance and talked to an executive there and basically got told to go pound sand. Microsoft's calling Netscape 15 minutes and just told to not be interested, not just not interested but don't even try calling back when you're at Microsoft. You kind of get used to being kind of Lords of the industry and everybody paying you some an homage at some point in time It's clear that Netscape culturally already perceived Microsoft as the people to take out. On the 13th of October, 1994, after months of feverish non-stop coding, netscape's new web browser navigator finally hit the streets from this moment. Conflict was inevitable with Netscape cast as the upstart. David and Microsoft as the mighty Goliath. Now you might not think that David would have much of a chance in this fight but from the moment Netscape's browser navigator was launched, it was an instant runaway success. When the first release was set up in one of the conference rooms. A computer was setup to watch the downloads. We had a sound effect be a cannon shot every time somebody downloaded the software and you know after a while it sounded like a war . Like a wildfire around the globe, the Internet age had truly begun and it had nothing to do with Microsoft. There's a point probably when Netscape got a million downloads and suddenly we thought what's going on? Million downloads, that's a pretty big number but the truth is the Microsoft's worries about Netscape ran a lot deeper than its little browser and to understand why requires just a little technical understanding in the computer business. The companies that have the most power control, known as a software platform, that's the software on which other programs run on top with this near monopoly over the Windows operating system. Microsoft controlled the ultimate platform. It was the one on which the whole computer business rose and fell and for years it was impossible to imagine that anyone could ever challenge its supremacy. But now Bill Gates as many rivals in Silicon Valley began to imagine a different future. A future where the browser could be an alternative platform, one where you could carry out all your computing needs online thereby leveling the playing field. The industry and rendering Windows, the most profitable software in the history of man. The completely irrelevant Netscape's sudden success was impossible for Microsoft to ignore. Suddenly Bill Gates got the importance of the web but the scale of his own strategic blunder and the need to rectify it right now. Late one night gates added his computer and pounded out a memo to his troops entitled, the internet tidal wave. He declared that the web was quote, the single most important development in computing, since the PC and he wrote about Netscape as quote "a new competitor born on the internet a competitor",that Microsoft absolutely had to quote match and beat. This was a complete take a right turn everybody right now. Starting now, not like next week or you know next month. Bills you know message to the company was let's go find lots of ways for us to to now engage in this new battle. It was absolutely like a sort of everyman/all hands on deck kind of call to action. The beginning of the browser in 1993 the internet was unknown and unloved outside a tiny circle of hard core computer hackers and scientists but by 1995 the situation had changed dramatically.

      <h3>Tim Berners-Lee</h3>
      <p>
        The World Wide Web invented in 1989 by an English scientist called Tim Berners-Lee. It's one of those technologies that you don't know you need until you start using it. Now today we're all used to the web with its fancy video and graphics and sound. Where one mouse click is like rolling down a new path. Who knows where you'll end up but back then the web was very different. There were very few precious web pages and they consisted of nothing but line after line of boring text. There was hardly anything worth finding and no way to find it. A visionary University of Illinois computer science student Tim had a crazy idea. He imagined a future or everyone including regular people like you and me would use the web as part of our daily lives. He was working on a different product and then he got wild eyed about this thing called the web. The Internet at that point was really only for nerds.It was really only for academics and researchers and scientists and and there wasn't anything that ordinary people could do on it But it was so useful to the people who were using it that he always figured everybody should be able to use it but he was like "yeah man this stuff is gonna change the world". It'll be great you know. It's global hypermedia and so I was just like yeah okay whatever. Andreessen may have been the most excitable, but soon enough he and a bunch of his college programming pals worked on making the web easier and more intuitive to use. Adding images pictures audio and video capabilities. The fruit of their labors was this: a dead simple piece of point-and-click software. The world's first graphical web browser and every time you surf the Internet today you're using one of its descendants.In the fall of 1993, the Illinois geeks posted mosaic online and made it a freely downloadable gift to humanity, and what a gift it turned out to be. The announcement was first posted on a new script on Usenet newsgroup. At that point, the browser was sent to to 12 people and then it just went viral from there. So it spread from 12 to a hundred to a thousand to ten thousand to a hundred thousand to a million.
        This was the moment when the internet went from obscurity to ubiquity from a toy for geeks to a tool for scientists.
